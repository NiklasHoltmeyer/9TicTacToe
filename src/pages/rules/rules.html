			<li>Each turn, you mark one of the small squares.</li>
			<li>When you get three in a row on a small board, you’ve won that board.</li>
			<li>To win the game, you need to win more boards than your opponent.</li>
			<li>You don’t get to pick which of the nine boards to play on.
				<ul>
					<li>- That’s determined by your opponent’s previous move.</li>
					<li>- Whichever square he picks, that’s the board you must play in next. (And whichever square you pick will determine which board he plays on next.)</li>
				</ul>

			<li>What if my opponent sends me to a board that’s already been won?
				<ul>
					<li>- In that case, congratulations you get to go anywhere you like, on any of the other boards.</li>
